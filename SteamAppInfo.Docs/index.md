# SteamAppInfo

This is a project that aims to provide a simple interface for retrieving Steam app information from the appinfo.vdf file within the local appcache.  
The library is quite small and doesn't have many features. This is intentional as the purpose is merely to provide a simple interface for retrieving app information from the local app cache.

## Special mentions

This project would not have been possible without the [ValveKeyValue](https://github.com/ValveResourceFormat/ValveKeyValue) project by xPaw.
